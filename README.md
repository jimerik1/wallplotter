## Excalidraw.com

The app hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) is a minimal showcase of what you can build with Excalidraw. Its [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/excalidraw-app) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

- 📡&nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&nbsp;Real-time collaboration.
- 🔒&nbsp;End-to-end encryption.
- 💾&nbsp;Local-first support (autosaves to the browser).
- 🔗&nbsp;Shareable links (export to a readonly link you can share with others).

We'll be adding these features as drop-in plugins for the npm package in the future.
